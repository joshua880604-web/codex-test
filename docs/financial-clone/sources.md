# Sources and evidence

Accessed 2026-10-19. The source directory and all linked financial pages were read as text. Research files retain exact URLs and limits. Source text access does not verify original DOM defaults, interactive submissions, or visual parity.

## Evidence boundaries

- 222 automated checks passed; default-case smoke is not complete formula verification.
- Article worked examples are distinct from submitted source-form cases.
- 71 local routes and 157 local modes passed browser interaction checks.
- Representative mobile/tablet widths: five routes; not every tool was individually tested on every viewport.
- Original form/visual parity remains unverified, and known behavior differences are in remaining-work.md.
- TinyFish was discovered as an available, uninstalled browser integration and suggested for the missing reference-browser capability. No connection has been confirmed and no TinyFish action has been performed.

### Supplemental official rule research — 2026-10-19

See `research/auto-state-rules.json` for state revenue agency statutes/guides and eligibility restrictions; `research/depreciation-details.json` for original observed partial-year controls and independent Microsoft SLN/SYD/DDB/VDB examples; `research/rent-bond-details.json` for bond pricing example and unresolved rent ratios/day-count variants. Text observations do not verify dropdown contents or live form submissions.

### Calculation audit sources — 2026-10-19

71 original page-text accesses are logged in audit-source-access.json. Original retirement/401(k)/annuity/IRR pages and IRS Schedule 1-A, Schedule A, Schedule SE and 2021 Publication 590-B were consulted for current findings; see calculation-audit.md for URLs and evidence types. Parameterized source requests for retirement and loan were inaccessible. Original default fields and live submissions remain unverified.

VAT workflow source: https://www.calculator.net/vat-calculator.html explicitly requests any two of rate/net/gross/tax. Pair formulas follow gross=net+tax and tax=net*rate. Native source submissions and error strings remain unavailable; see specs/vat.md for the independent validation policy.

SEO editorial sources are linked visibly in the ten guides in src/lib/guides.ts: GOV.UK VAT, CFPB amortization/mortgage explanations, SEC Investor.gov compound-interest definitions, IRS retirement limits, Publication 590-B and 2026 revenue procedures. Example arithmetic is independently tested. Google Search Central AI-feature/content/canonical guidance informs technical choices, without claiming special GEO markup or guaranteed inclusion. See seo-geo.md.

## 2026-10-20 content expansion

The 60 additional guides link to project methodology and each existing reference calculator URL as feature provenance, not as certification of mathematical/interaction parity. Added tax examples use already documented 2026 tables from official-rules.json and link their recorded IRS bulletin. No new tax year or policy was inferred. Independently specified elementary arithmetic/closed-form installment cases are checked in tests/seo.test.ts. Content topics are candidate intents; no keyword-volume dataset, live rankings or AI-citation dataset was obtained.

## 2026-10-21 — Independent evergreen additions

The six new tools use independently stated algebra/recurrences and local fixtures, not claimed source-site submissions. User screenshots supply keyword research (research/evergreen-keywords-2026-10-21.json); no organic-ranking difficulty is inferred from ad competition. Models and limits: evergreen-additions-2026-10-21.md and specs/{markup,cagr,emergency-fund,break-even,investment-fee,real-return}.md. Public source and test code are linked as implementation evidence rather than fabricated external review.

## 2026-10-22 — Glossary sources

## 2026-10-22 — Methodology presentation and policy references

Read current source modules/data metadata and selected documentation. Omni's editorial policy informs presentation of sources/checks/dates, not a claim of matching its personnel or peer-review process. No current-market forecast was inferred for existing defaults.

## 2026-10-26 — Category organization

This change uses the authorized classification proposal and the existing source catalog, captured routes/modes/default-result hashes, canonical/sitemap and redirect artifacts. No new financial or policy sources are needed because mathematical models and rules are unchanged.
