# Implementation decisions

- Local-only development: no Sites registration, deployment, public hosting, account, or paid service created.
- Next.js 16.4.2 / React, TypeScript; Node.js 24+. package-lock.json pins installed dependencies.
- Reference routes were resolved from the actual directory, including tax-calculator.html and debt-ratio-calculator.html.
- 71 directory entries consist of 70 calculators and the Real Estate directory. Do not invent a formula for the directory.
- Pure numeric functions are separated from UI. Shared components render inputs and outputs; business logic remains specific to each tool.
- Original-site access: text web retrieval available; original DOM computed styles, form default values, option lists, screenshots, and form submission are NOT verified. A query-based attempt to submit a source loan example was inaccessible. No network-policy bypass attempted.
- Browser QA uses portable local Playwright and system Chromium. Its findings apply to the local implementation, not reference-site visual parity.
- Regular loan math retains floating-point precision internally; display uses two decimals. Explicit conservation and terminal-payment fixtures guard accumulated error. This does not establish parity with a lender's cent-rounded daily-interest ledger.
- Data: IRS 2025/2026, SSA 2026, IRS RMD Table II/III, BLS CPI-U through September 2026. No 2026 annual CPI fabricated; October 2025 remains missing.
- Frankfurter v2 daily-reference route; archived USD cross-rate snapshot covers 165 actual currencies and retains each component's date. Feed failure is clearly identified as saved-reference fallback. Coinbase public spot endpoint handles BTC when reachable; no stored BTC value is fabricated.
- Full one-to-one acceptance remains open until reference interactions and visual checks can run. Local route/mode availability is tracked separately from verified completion.

## 2026-10-19: schedule aggregation and documented business-rule corrections

- Added yearly views only for known repayment schemas; sum payments/interest/principal/costs, preserve ending balances and last dates. CSV exports the active view. Year labels are loan years, not calendar years.
- Auto dealer-purchase tax-base rules cover California, Texas, Florida, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan and Washington. Rates are never inferred. Other jurisdictions and boat purchases remain manual. Eligibility restrictions and local surtaxes are stated in results. The original source prose lists Michigan as disallowing trade credits, whereas official Michigan rules allow a capped credit; use the official 2026 $12,000 cap and record the disagreement rather than reproducing an obsolete rule. See research/auto-state-rules.json.
- Cash-back comparisons include entered fees, tax, trade equity and upfront cash. Zero default tax/fees preserve an explicit no-tax comparison.
- DDB no longer forces remaining book value to salvage at the end of useful life. This matches independent Microsoft DDB examples; no implicit straight-line switch. Rounding is capped to remaining basis. Fractional useful-life years are rejected rather than silently rounded.
- Actual-days depreciation is independently defined: inclusive service date through first fiscal year end, divided by that fiscal-year length; remaining service-year fractions carry forward. Original convention labels are unverified. No MACRS claim. See research/depreciation-details.json.
- Bond coupon dates are computed from an anchored maturity day, maintaining month ends. Accrued days are exposed. Exact original 30/360 and Actual/Actual variants remain unverified. See research/rent-bond-details.json.

## 2026-10-19: explicit annual 401(k) contribution iteration

User requested annual iteration for Employee contributions. The projection already iterated annually; employee/employer summary totals now derive directly from the annual rows. No monthly contribution model or current-salary-times-years approximation is used. Each year uses its starting salary and starting age cap, grows the opening balance, adds year-end contributions, then increases salary for the next year. English description, formula and result notes state the timing, fixed 2026 caps, excluded existing balance/returns/employer match, and display rounding. Independent fixtures cover rising salaries, matching, age 49-to-50 limits and zero remaining working years. 234 checks, TypeScript and production build passed; no new browser session was run for this wording and aggregation update.

## 2026-10-19: include starting balance in employee contribution summary

User requested adding Current 401(k) balance to the Employee contributions result. This supersedes the previous summary definition. Label now reads “Employee contributions + current balance” and equals entered starting balance plus the annual employee-contribution sum. Yearly Employee rows remain new contributions only. Starting balance is included once, not added to each annual contribution or added again to projected balance. Notes clarify historical employer funds/returns may already be in starting balance, while future employer matching and future returns are excluded from this summary. Added a two-year $100,000 starting-balance fixture (summary $116,240; projected balance $131,588), zero-contribution and retirement-boundary checks. All 235 tests, typecheck and production build pass. Browser interactions were not rerun for this result/wording change.

## 2026-10-19: calculation accuracy audit

Audited all 71 directory URLs for text accessibility, cross-checked original prose/annuity schedule cases and IRS forms, and reviewed shared numerical code plus key retirement/tax business rules. Reproduced and fixed eight groups: annual retirement contribution labeling; first-year annual and first-month withdrawal inflation timing; investment zero/already-met/month-count solver errors; stationary/nearby IRR roots; RMD table effective-year mismatch and negative projections; ordinary SE earnings below $400; and MFS eligibility for qualified vehicle-interest deduction. See calculation-audit.md and tests/audit.test.ts. Retain confirmed IRS floor rounding for tips/overtime and final-half MFS SALT computation. Full same-input original submissions remain inaccessible. User-customized 401(k) starting-balance summary is preserved.

## 2026-10-19: VAT matches the documented any-two workflow

Replaced four separate VAT modes with one four-field optional-input form and a pure solver for all six known-value pairs. Zero is a real supplied value. Exact-two input checks, inconsistent price/tax detection and indeterminate zero-case errors are explicit. Clear empties all fields. Query hydration clears defaults before reading supplied VAT fields, preserving new/legacy shared links. Main financial mode count decreases by three (157 to 154) because four limited forms became one broader form; no known-value pair was removed. Original defaults/error handling/screenshot parity remain unverified. See specs/vat.md.

## 2026-10-19: SEO and AI-search readiness

Use explicit SITE_URL and SITE_INDEXABLE configuration; no guessed domain, training-bot bypass or fictional expert identity. Default previews emit noindex/follow, with an empty unadvertised sitemap. Public canonical origin and indexing require an intentional production build; Vercel preview remains noindex. Consolidate root directory via 308. All calculator models/formulas are server-visible, ten guides contain twelve tested examples and official/contextual sources, and related links are topic-specific. Schema describes actual WebApplication/WebPage/BreadcrumbList content without fake reviews or a guaranteed rich-result claim. See seo-geo.md. Financial model limitations are made visible, not concealed by SEO copy.

## 2026-10-19: usability and category loading

Retain financial math and compact layout. Improve mobile controls, accessible matching descriptions, year-end table terminology and Reset naming. Serialize form definitions/default results from the server, and dynamically load only the requested calculation category. Directory search uses the metadata catalog, not the calculation registry. See ui-performance.md for measured bytes and validation limits.

## 2026-10-19: Marriage Tax paired layout

Replace positional first-eight-field display with semantic paired sections. Keep both partners’ essential inputs visible, retain all 71 fields, group optional inputs and promote the signed tax difference as clearly labeled savings/additional tax. No tax model or defaults changed. See marriage-layout.md.

## 2026-10-20: remaining calculator guides

Add specific guides, two contextual questions and reproducible arithmetic fixtures to each of the remaining 60 functional tools. Preserve all financial engines and current UI. Keep examples server-rendered; retain honest scope for fixed 30-year rent/buy, simplified Social Security and paycheck models, manual currency quotes and program eligibility. Search intent candidates are documented without invented search-volume claims. See content-expansion.md.

## 2026-10-20 keyword ownership and feature alignment

Use the user-provided global/US English, rolling-12-month Keyword Planner screenshots to prioritize intent. Each intent has an existing primary page; no near-duplicate landing URLs are created. Add compound growth, savings-goal modes and monthly loan extra-payment comparison before claiming these capabilities in metadata. Retain conversion and original mode IDs. Directory intent search and visible shortcut buttons make the features discoverable. See keyword-implementation.md.

## 2026-10-20: globally applicable everyday tools

Add percentage, tip/bill splitting, calendar dates and unit conversion as a separate Everyday Tools category. Preserve the financial baseline of 71 entries. Support explicit display currencies, exact minor-unit share allocation, timezone-independent dates and dimension-safe metric/US/Imperial conversion. No tipping custom, currency rate or business-day calendar is inferred. See everyday-tools.md.

## 2026-10-20: HELOC annual fee

Model annual account-maintenance fees during draw only. Correct repayment, fee totals and APR cash flows; preserve the charge query key and explicitly disclose monthly averaging/pro-rating rather than claiming exact annual billing. See heloc-annual-fee.md.

## 2026-10-20: IRR numerical and timing review

Use signed log-scaled evaluation with exact same-time decimal netting, finite-input limits and conventional-flow bracketing. Preserve the bounded multiple-root search and disclose numerical limits. Reject silently rounded payment periods; label effective annual rates and period/time schedule correctly. Preserve existing mode IDs and raw numeric reference expectations. See irr-review.md.

## Scientific calculator — 2026-10-20

Added a safe expression parser, keypad, degree/radian modes and three worked examples. 431 tests and production build pass; 12 dedicated browser checks pass. See scientific-calculator.md. Public upload remains pending explicit authorization, including the preceding IRR update.

## Homepage layout — 2026-10-20

Homepage alone now uses full width with search, eight quick links, category jumps and responsive category sections. No dependency or formula changes. Production build, 11 dedicated browser checks, 20 UI regression checks and 80-page SEO build checks pass. See homepage-layout.md. Scientific/IRR upload was completed in 60ecb290; the user has explicitly authorized this homepage update for synchronization.

## Retirement parity batch — 2026-10-20

443 tests and production build pass. Added separate 401(k) retirement schedule/CSV, safe matching-rate window and infeasibility warning, early-withdrawal qualification fields, and separate annual deposits in Retirement monthly withdrawals. Three examples bring the total to 103. Source form numerical parity remains unverified; no hosted deployment; the user explicitly authorized GitHub synchronization after validation. See retirement-parity-improvements.md.

## Reference-first functionality with expert fallback — 2026-10-20

User superseded the custom 401(k) summary preference with source-first functionality, and explicitly authorized independent expert models when original behavior cannot be observed. Added a 71-entry reference-function-map.json, refreshed all corresponding specs, restored Compound Interest converter as default, and exposed documented controls/outputs across property, investment, retirement, tax, paycheck and commission. 469 tests and production build pass; 76 routes / 173 modes and all 107 examples pass browser checks. Exact original-source result parity remains unverified. No upload or hosted deployment in this batch. See strict-functionality-policy.md.

## 2026-10-21 — Six independent evergreen tools

User authorized six fixed-formula calculators based on their US Keyword Planner research. Preserve existing overlapping modes, transfer broad Markup and Investment Fee search targets to the new pages, and link rather than duplicate historical inflation or annualized-return content. Implement fee timing and net-return handling explicitly, not as a claim of daily expense-ratio precision. Keep noindex, static export and no API. See evergreen-additions-2026-10-21.md.

## 2026-10-22 — Small glossary section

User approved eight concise, source-checked glossary pages, a /glossary/ index and contextual calculator links. Dedicated definitions answer informational intent; existing guides retain operational calculation detail. Preserve calculator URLs and indexability environment gates. Finalize only glossary exports to directory indexes for the requested URL shape. No mass content pipeline or unrelated eCPM article; no rankings/citation guarantees. Evidence and scope: glossary-2026-10-22.md.

## 2026-10-22 — Methodology transparency

User requested an Omni-informed methodology improvement. Preserve the established page/canonical and distinguish actual validation from unsupported authority claims. Generate example default values from real field configurations; explain that future returns/inflation are editable illustrative presets with no recorded empirical calibration. Keep official rules, historical observations and stored FX dates separate. Publish actual review scope, reproducible examples, rounding and explicit issue-reporting path. No invented professional reviewers or AdSense approval claims; no runtime AI/API service. See methodology-review-2026-10-22.md.

## 2026-10-22 — Public domain exclusion

User explicitly requested removal of the reference domain from the website. Remove visible mentions, outbound exits and unused serialized runtime provenance; keep research provenance only in documentation that is not copied to the public export. Preserve genuine official source links. Enforce the requirement on the complete static export at build time, including JavaScript and RSC payloads. Internal provenance is not a source for public-model fields.
