   <p>Published by <SiteLink href="/about#publisher">{publisherName}</SiteLink>. AI tools assist implementation and drafting. Calculator outputs come from formula-based code running in your browser; there is no runtime AI calculation service.</p>
   <p>Sources, examples and model limitations are documented on this page. The checking methods are described in our <SiteLink href="/methodology#validation">calculation methodology</SiteLink>. Numerical checks test the stated scenarios; they do not establish complete coverage of tax rules, contracts or personal circumstances.</p>
   <p>No named independent professional review is claimed for this page. See our <SiteLink href="/methodology#editorial-policy">authorship and review policy</SiteLink> for how publishing, arithmetic checks and professional review are distinguished.</p>
