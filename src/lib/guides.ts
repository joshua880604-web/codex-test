  retirement: {question:"What if I am already at my retirement age?",answer:"In Required Savings, set current age equal to retirement age. There is no remaining saving period, so the result shows Additional savings needed now rather than a zero monthly saving requirement. A shortfall is the target retirement balance minus existing savings, with a minimum of zero."},
  '401k': {question:"Does the employee contribution total include my current 401(k) balance?",answer:"Employee contributions means new employee deposits over the projection. Starting 401(k) balance is separate, and Starting balance plus employee contributions combines them once. Employer matching and investment earnings are separate components. Future projections hold the stated 2026 limits fixed."},
  'mortgage-payoff': {question:"Do extra mortgage payments reduce property taxes and insurance?",answer:"The payoff comparison models loan principal and interest. Extra principal can reduce future interest and shorten payoff time, but property taxes and homeowners insurance do not disappear when the mortgage is repaid. Lender prepayment penalties and accrued daily payoff interest are excluded."},
  repayment: {question:"When is a one-time extra loan payment applied?",answer:"Enter a whole payment month. Month 1 is the first scheduled payment in the projection. Extra payments are capped at the remaining principal and that period's interest; payments scheduled after payoff have no effect. The model does not include prepayment penalties."},

Custom Exchange Rate uses the rate you enter; Saved Reference Rates uses historical data bundled with the site and displays its dates. Neither mode requests external data. Snapshots do not update automatically and do not represent an executable bank quote; BTC conversion requires a manual rate."},

guides.mortgage.questions.push({question:'Is cancellation at 80% LTV the same as automatic PMI termination?',answer:'No. The 80% option assumes a borrower-requested cancellation is approved. The separate automatic termination rule generally uses 78% of original value on the original payment schedule and requires payments to be current. This calculator does not automatically determine those conditions or midpoint termination.'});

  {question:'Which home value is used for the 80% PMI option?',answer:'For a purchase loan, original value is the lower of the purchase price and appraisal at purchase. Enter that original appraisal when it is below the price; leaving it blank assumes it is at least the price. This option assumes borrower-requested cancellation is approved and does not use a current market appraisal.'},
  {question:'What happens if my down payment covers the whole purchase price?',answer:'Both monthly and biweekly modes show that no mortgage loan is needed. Entered property tax, home insurance, HOA and other ownership costs still appear as initial monthly and annual amounts. There is no amortization schedule or loan-interest saving, and the calculator does not infer a lifetime ownership-cost total.'},
  {question:'Can I enter a partial year or a dated extra principal payment?',answer:'A partial year is allowed when years × 12 + months is a whole number of months; for example, 1.5 years is 18 months. Each dated extra-payment row must contain exactly two nonempty comma-separated values: payment month, amount. Enter 1,1000 for an extra 1000 in month 1, without thousands separators. Multiple valid rows for the same month are added together.'}

guides.mortgage.questions.push({question:'Does PMI automatically change with my down payment?',answer:'Yes. Monthly Mortgage defaults to Automatic estimate. It uses original LTV, the selected credit score range and loan term with National MI Monthly Advantage base rates effective March 1, 2022, reviewed October 26, 2026. For a 400,000 purchase, 30-year fixed loan and assumed credit score 740–759, 4% down estimates 224 per month at 0.70% annually; 15% down estimates about 56.67 per month at 0.20%. Actual lender pricing and eligibility may differ. Select Manual for your actual quote. Homeowners insurance is a separate expense.'});
guides.mortgage.questions.push({question:'What assumptions does automatic PMI use?',answer:'It is an illustrative unadjusted borrower-paid monthly base-rate estimate for a fixed-rate, one-unit primary-residence purchase, standard agency coverage, up to two borrowers and DTI at most 45%. The default credit score assumption is 740–759 and can be changed. Original value is the lower purchase price or original appraisal. Supported PMI-bearing loans have original LTV up to 97% and terms up to 40 years; a result does not establish loan eligibility. Premiums use original principal, reducing to the lesser of the starting annual rate or 0.20% after 120 payments. Requested cancellation at 80% original value is assumed approved; 78% automatic termination and midpoint rules remain outside this model. Manual mode retains entered dollar or percentage quotes and cancellation settings. Biweekly Comparison excludes ownership expenses and PMI.'});
